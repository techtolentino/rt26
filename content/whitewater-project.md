# Whitewater Project

### A platform focused on improving product team efficiency by prioritizing people, practices, and tooling.

### Introduction

Part of IBM’s global digital transformation, the Whitewater project had a vision of empowering teams to acquire the best tools available on the market. In addition to modernizing tool stacks, our mission also included guiding teams to adopt research-based collaborative workflows.

### Problems to solve

Internal product teams from around the world not only used outdated applications, but many of them were relying on old practices and fading methodologies. As a result, teams weren’t as efficient as they could be.

With this in mind, our team set out to ask and answer the following questions:

☐ How might we enable teams to improve their workflow?
☐ What can we do to help business units communicate better?
☐ What is holding teams back from delivering with confidence and speed?

##### Team overview

- Design team in Austin, TX and Engineering in Raleigh, NC
- Each squad was 8 people or less
- Agile sprints, 2-week cycles
- Leveraged a lot of design thinking practices
- Collaboration via Slack, GitHub, Sketch, ZenHub, and Mural

### Roles & contributions

This was the first real product team I joined. My role as a Front-end developer was to build the UI and contribute to our team design system, support best practices learning sessions, and capture user needs in our backlog. Additionally, being a member of the Design team allowed me to make significant contributions to a variety of design thinking activities.

##### Teammates

### Process

**Our users were our north star**
A critical aspect of this transformation was cultivating empathy and respect for colleagues who had established successful models for managing their projects. To gain their buy-in, it was essential to engage with teams thoughtfully, using an approach that prioritized their best interest.

**Release fast, continuously learn, and work to improve**
Our team was busy, nonstop. After completing each sprint, we constantly shared progress with stakeholders, partner teams, and external users, to validate designs, get feedback from what was shipped to production, and learn of discover potential gaps in our solution.

It was a reiterative cycle of: user research → design exploration → development → test → improve.

**Playbacks and education**
Every tool we released on Whitewater came with education and support. This enablement component allowed us to work directly with teams and offer proven patterns of best-practices that they could easily adopt into their workstreams.

##### Activities

- Front end development
- User testing
- Hills workshop
- Rapid prototyping
- Sponsor user interviews
- Agile iterations
- The Whitewater Platform gave teams access to modernized tools with best practices

### What we built

The Whitewater platform started as a web application that served as a one stop shop for tools and practices. In the end, the project turned into a full ecosystem centered around tool adoption and empowering workflows.

☑ Teams were able to access and modernize toolchains through simplified licensing workstreams
☑ We delivered a field-guide catalog around best practices
☑ Provided workshops to teams around the world to boost collaboration

### Impact

- Streamlined communication across the entire company by onboarding teams onto Slack Enterprise Grid
- Engineering teams from all organizations moved their codebase into GitHub Enterprise, creating a culture of inner-source
