# Qiskit Metal

### Using design thinking activities to find pain points and improve the experience for quantum chip designers.

### Introduction

The Qiskit Metal project was an open source project that allowed scientists and engineers to design quantum chips using a graphical user interface. As the project began to gain adoption, the team reached out to our digital experiences team for UX design consultation.

### Problems to solve

While the user interface offered the functionality users required, the overall look and feel of the application seemed cluttered. This was the perfect opportunity for the design guidance to help improve the following areas:

☐ The usage of color was vast, and the iconography lacked a cohesive system
☐ Various elements in the UI were competing with one another
☐ Users had to split their workflow between two tools: Jupyter Notebooks and the Qiskit Metal UI

##### Team overview

- 4 Designers, only 20% dedicated
- Qiskit Metal had 1 UI Engineer
- 3-month engagement
- Collaboration via Figma, Slack, and Mural

### Roles & contributions

Owning this engagement required me to step in as the representative for our design team. I was responsible for facilitating communication between the Metal team and ours, pulling together any resources we needed, and co-owning a design thinking workshop to identify pain points and gain team alignment.

##### Teammates

- Russell Huffman
- Terra Banal
- Tobi Lasisi

### Process

**Design workshop**
Instead of just 'redesigning the UI', I wanted to ensure that the Metal team was aligned on their users’ pain points. This would guarantee that designs were influenced by user motivation.

**Solving one challenge at a time**
Our design workshop was a success. We had 9 people meet over the course of 3 half-day sessions, including full participation by the Metal team. During that time, we were able to arrive at an improved user experience by exposing a few issues in user onboarding and the multi-tool workflow.

**Screens and iterations**
Once we finished our workshop playbacks, I was ready for exploration and ideation. Using the Carbon Design System components, I proposed several ideas to our Senior Designer. After multiple iterations, we were ready to present our designs to the Metal team.

##### Activities

- Low / high fidelity designing
- User testing
- Hills workshop
- Rapid prototyping
- Sponsor user interviews
- Agile iterations

_Our design workshop used collaborative activities to expose opportunities for improvement_

### Explorations

_Started by bringin user flows into Figma and exploring first time user experience_

_An improved Getting Started design and a more cohesive user interface_

### Deliverables

By the end of our collaboration, we were able to provide the Qiskit Metal team with UX guidelines and a design system to continue building their application. The goal was to ensure that their UI engineer had all the necessary resources to implement the proposed designs.

☑ The UI was cleaned up with improved typography, colors, and iconography
☑ With the slideout code editor panel, users can stay within one application instead of splitting their workflow into two apps
☑ The onboarding experience allowed users to get to where they needed to start, in a simpler experience
