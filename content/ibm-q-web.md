# IBM Quantum Web

### A user-friendly landing page that allows visitors to explore IBM’s quantum offerings, stay updated on the roadmap, experiment with SDKs, register for industry events, and more.

### Introduction

The IBM Quantum Experience Team is responsible for designing and delivering the digital experience for multiple public-facing platforms. Anyone interested in the business of quantum computing will interact with one of team's applications.

### Problems to solve

It’s a common challenge that many large business units face: you have one mission, but many teams contributing in their own unique ways.

With many projects in progress, IBM Quantum’s user-facing platforms in 2023 were widespread, which unintentionally evolved into a disjointed user journey. Each project had its own team, code base, and timeline, inadvertently creating a slightly different user experience. Through user and stakeholder feedback, the following pain points were surfaced:

☐ The quantum web presence was overwhelming, with a lot of pieces in various places online
☐ The community was confused about what was considered IBM Quantum 'business' versus 'open source'
☐ Users, clients, and partners experienced disconnected user journeys

This fragmentation left the community confused about which elements were IBM and which were open source. The inconsistent messaging and branding further complicated the user experience.

##### Team overview

- Remotely distributed across 2 continents and 4 time zones
- Cross-functional team consisting of PM, design, dev, and content
- Sprint cadence of 1-week cycles
- Collaboration via Figma, GitHub, Slack, Box, and Mural
- Having different user interfaces created a confusing user experience.

### Roles & contributions

My responsibilities as a technical lead involve taking requirements from stakeholders, evaluating feasiblity, then transforming requests into development tasks in our backlog. With limited engineering resources, I collaborate directly with our product owner to ensure the proper prioritization is given to each workstream.

As a UX Engineer, my goal is to work in lockstep with our senior designers to come up with scalable, elegant solutions. In this capacity, I aim to leverage our design system through reusability and componentization. Once designs are finalized, I work with one other developer to implement new features, coordinate releases, and maintain the overall health of our codebase.

### Process

**Audit**
The first part of this consolidation effort involved conducting an audit of the various platforms that were publicly available. The Experience team examined the different user interfaces, brand usage, messaging, and content that were most consumed by our intended audiences.

**Design rebrand**
After the audit, our Brand team stepped in to implement an entirely evolved brand system, still based off of the Carbon Design system as the foundation. This new branding, however, would represent the maturity and evolution of IBM Quantum as a whole.

**One experience**
The main initiative was take all of these platforms and create one experience. We would later call this initiatve "1XP", for one experience. With the longest history of the IBM Quantum marketing site at the time, I would naturally assume the role of dev lead for implementing the web portion of 1XP.

##### Activities

- Front end development
- Rapid prototyping
- Design thinking workshop
- Journey mapping
- User stories
- A/B testing
- Pair designing
- Continuous delivery

_Building Figma into real components allowed us to test early on and gain team alignment._

### Solution

Our approach to having the new web experience ready by December involved a lot of prioritization and delivering MVP experiences. This meant that we had to release only the most critical parts of the new experience, at first, then once we launched, we could freely release updates and enhancements.

The new IBM Quantum presented a unified experience across several user touchpoints: the landing page, our Learning site, our Platform, and the documentation site.

☑ Consolidated a lot of duplicate content, resulting in a more streamlined experience
☑ Clarified distinction between IBM Quantum offerings and our open source offerings
☑ Created a more cohesive user journey, where clients and partners felt connected to the brand

_After 6 months, the team released the all new IBM Quantum website_

### Impact

The success of the new experience is evident in a variety of ways:

- An increase in conversions from unique website visits to logins or signups
- Improved monthly average of usage for our Platform
- Red Dot Design Award for Brands & Communication Design
